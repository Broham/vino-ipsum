Pinot Noir is the primary red grape of Burgundy, Champagne, Oregon and New Zealand. It is a temperamental thin-skinned grape that is sensitive to light exposure, pruning and soil types, generally low-yielding and highly susceptible to rot and fungal diseases. However, it can produce some of the world’s most sought-after and attractive wines, particularly from Burgundy’s Côte d’Or. Depending on its origins, wines produced with Pinot Noir exhibit a range of aromas, textures and flavors, but are commonly light to medium bodied with red berry and earthy characteristics.
